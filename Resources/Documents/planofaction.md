# Plan of Action

*A brief introduction about the relevance and importance of the project.*

In the realm of scientific inquiry, systematic reviews serve as invaluable tools for encapsulating the current understanding within a specific field. They often synthesize a broad range of results and may even aggregate data from multiple studies via meta-analysis for a more comprehensive view.

This project is being carried out at the Department of Biological Psychology at VU Amsterdam, responsible for the maintaining of the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR). One of the primary objectives of the NTR is to clarify the biological underpinnings of twinningâ€”both its occurrence and implications. Consequently, this constitutes the core subject matter of the current project.

For further information on the NTR, you can visit their official [website](https://tweelingenregister.vu.nl/).

To support the process of performing a systematic literature review on twinning, we'll leverage generative artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, the project aims to harness various AI models for tasks such as meta-analyses and guiding future research endeavors in accordance with the PICO framework, which stands for Patient/Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparison/Control, and Outcome measures.

The project will harness the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and will largely be driven by a semantic search engine using a vector database to find the most relevant results from abstracts and papers. This entire operation is controlled by a semantic search engine, which utilizes a vector database to sift through abstracts and papers, pinpointing the most relevant results. In addition, statistical methods are applied across the entire database to uncover anomalies and discern patterns, providing a deeper layer of analytical insight.

The value of this endeavour lies in its potential to effect a substantive contribution to the study of fertility pertaining to twinning at VU Amsterdam, and perhaps even to extend its impact to the wider scientific community.

Ultimately, the final application aims to present a meticulously curated corpus of articles. These would have undergone rigorous filtering processes to yield a selection of high-quality articles focused exclusively on the subject of twinning.

#### 1.1. Background
*A description of the background and context of the project.*

##### 1.1.1 Twinning
The subject of twinning holds a particular allure, often steeped in both biological intricacy and cultural fascination. While the basics like monozygotic and dizygotic twinning are well-understood, the role of fertility factors adds an extra layer of complexity. These factors, which include aspects like maternal age and hormonal fluctuations, influence the likelihood of twinning. Our larger project seeks to dig deeper into these fertility factors to identify which are most influential in twinning occurrences, not just in humans but also across different mammalian species.

Existing research primarily explores either twinning or fertility within specific species, but rarely both across species. A notable exception is a study focused on aggression, which may serve as an inspiration for this project. The end goal is to discover papers where experimental research overlaps across species but hasn't been individually examined for such intersections.

Specific attention is directed towards cattle for two main reasons: first, extensive research has been conducted in the livestock industry with a profit motive for multiple births; second, a significant portion of a genetic region known to influence twinning (and possibly fertility) is shared between cattle and humans.

The correlation between fertility and the likelihood of multiple births remains ambiguous. While twinning has been traditionally seen as a form of 'super-fertility,' some studies suggest that it is possible to experience reduced fertility while still having higher chances of multiple births. For instance, the release of the FSH hormone, commonly observed when women quit smoking, could be a factor in multiple ovulations.

Studies that are commonly associated with twinning but not directly relevant to fertility will be treated as 'negative filters' in our search for relevant literature. For example, twins are often used in hereditary studies based on the ACE model and broad-sense heritability. These types of studies may appear in the dataset but are not directly pertinent to our investigation.

Also, epigenetic studies often target identical twins exhibiting discordant traits to explore the impact of a single factor on epigenetic expression. However, our research puts the emphasis on dizygotic twins, making such studies less relevant for our purposes.

By focusing on these specific elements and filtering out the non-relevant ones, the project aims to address gaps in current scientific understanding.
##### 1.1.2 Generative AI
As we traverse what's commonly termed 'the AI revolution,' the proliferation of ground-breaking papers is ceaseless, each contributing revolutionary models and algorithms. Particularly noteworthy are advancements rooted in transformer architectures and embeddings, such as forefront Large Language Models like GPT-4 and LLaMa2. These are fundamentally altering our methodology for information retrieval and interpretation. Given the volatile nature of this field, the project remains agile, adapting to the latest in scientific discovery while adhering to current best practices.
#### 1.2. Objectives
*What the project aims to achieve.*

The project aspires to refine and facilitate scientific research, focusing specifically on PICO-based reviews and meta-analyses. The objective is twofold: to simplify these complex processes and to elevate the quality of their outcomes. This efficiency opens the door for researchers to delve more deeply into their areas of inquiry, providing a richer, more nuanced understanding of the subject matter.

## 2. Problem Statement
*The challenge or problem that will be addressed during the internship.*

The primary objective is to create a software application that effectively assists researchers in performing reviews.
